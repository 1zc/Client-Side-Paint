# Player Paint

This is a SourceMod plugin intended to provide the +paint feature to players for visibility and to mark landmarks, with decals being fully client-sided. This is ideal for movement game-mode servers that want to provide the feature to players, but do not want it to be abused to destroy visibility in public servers!
